I OWE YOU

the three words on which the entire global system was founded, is based and will be doomed
OR
why developing democracies are and shall remain inherently violent
OR
why china can not take over the world from america without winning a violent world war.

Today we live in a complex and turbulent world that is very difficult to comprehend as a funcioning whole. Innundated with a flood of detail information we wrongly believe that consuming and analysing this deluge will lead to a better understanding of this whole. We forget that this information is merely a component of the whole and end up chasin our own tails with vague words like "big data". The fact is poverty exists along with wealth, the world is both a peacful and a violent place.
In addition, the panacea of democracy has worked exceptionally well in the developed world but failed miserably to deliver anything but violence and more poverty across the developing world.
Why?
Why are some rich and others poor?
Why has china not yet taken over the world?
Will China ever take over the world and what will be the necessary pre-requisites?
Why are developing countries helplessly doomed by definition no matter how they are established or eforced?
Why are developing countries forced to chose between cargo-cult like copying of the wasy of the developed world and pro-active self mutilation?
What does the future hold for our global society?
In this set of essays I propose a fundamental on which society has stood for millenia. If this holds, and I strongly believe that it does, then according to Lidy's law (https://medium.com/@tanayj/the-lindy-effect-and-betting-on-things-that-never-change-130880ec35af) we can use the fundamental to profoundly understand the nature of today's society, to comprehend its problems and their solutions and to predict exactly where we will be in the future with greater certainty.
These are not easy questions to ask and are even more dificult to answer using the flood of information we all swim in these days. What I propose takes a step back and answers them comprehensively and conclusively from the point of view of what I regard as the foundational pillar on which categorically all  society on earth is built, continues to be built, and will definitely be built in the future if society is at all to survive as we know it. This fundamental pilar is a very simple set of
three words "I owe you". These words are the fundamental bonds upon which civilisation (and the greater realm of nature) can be seen to be built, sustained and grown. The breaking of this bond has been, is and will continue to be the greatest destructive force we yield agains society and nature as a whole. The future becomes intuitively obvious once this is understood.


From antiquity the fundamental unit of social cohabitation was the family. A sexually reproductive pair produce helpless/vulnerable children totally dependent on their parents for survival throught their development years. Granted this was re-interpreted in many ways over time and in different societies (e.g. the spartans claim to have been a nation family of sorts). In effect, in all incarnations of this scheme, the dependents were continuosly filling out one big long "I owe you" note piecemeal
redeemable in time by those they were temporarily dependant on for their survival and development. In the case of Sparta it was repayed primarily by fighting in the army, for others it could be as simple as feeding your childhood caregivers in their old age. The primary infantile care-givers be they individuals or groups, and being well able to aquire the pre-requisite sustenance surplusses, were willing participants in this long term, unwritten contract knowing that they will deminish as those that they gave care to strengthened and took over their responsibilities with time.
Given there continued to be more resources at hand than are required to susstain the care giver, they were happy to invest the surplusses by storing these in the care given to their dependants rather than allowing the surplus to spoil and be cycled back through nature in other means outside of their more direct benefit. If done properly they could draw down on this promisory situation as and when the tides of life and fortune turn against them and in favour of their dependents.
Sometimes this paid off less than others but on the whole and given the general availability of surplus remained adequate the investment continued to make sense irrespective. No documents were drawn up and the records were subjectively kept/interpreted (or sometimes taught through stories to the dependant members of the unit).

All the same, such investment was largely immeasurable and inherently emotional. The word emotional here is used in the philosophical tradition of Baruch Spinoza who believed that the emotions are indispensable representations of inherent voids in articulated and reasonable knowledge. The dependents  could not help but feel indebted to their temporal benefactors and more often than not, repayed them in kind if and when the situation changed. Though the system was not fool proof it had serious
consequences both for to reward compliance and to punish violation that stretched across time and space from the immediate to distant and future members of society. It was not until Darwin that these ramifications were seriously studdied and began to be better articulatedin what we refer to today as the theory of evolution even though we still tend not to appretiate its more subtle and widely infleuntial implications outside of biological circles.

Karl Marx tried to think this into an offitial theology about the way society should be goverened with catastrphic consequences in the parts of the world which tried to implement this thinking.He essentially recognized that the "I owe you" relationship between the benefactor and the dependent could be reworded as "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs". This was no doubt intelectual brilliance on his part, but unfortunately an over-simplification of a very complex
system that had already come a long and painful way from the pre-historic, sparsely populated world of nucleated hunter-gatheres. In fact, nature had already met and applied solutions to the very problems that Marx was contemplating as Darwin was discovering around the same time. However, for better or for worse, "Das Kapital" was more directly applicable to society at the time than the rather abstract musings in "Origin of Species". The "Wealth of Nations" by Adam smith was a more
pertinent representation of the opposition to Marx's ideas if ever there was one at the time.It promised great wealth in the benthamite prose of "the greatest happiness of the greatest number" . the great American nation was founded on it and over the next century proved superior to all the nations founded on derivations of Marx's ideas. Unfortunately today, it too and the resulting global system is looking systemically rather shaky after suffering a series of systemic
shocks the latest of which (the corona pandemic) looks set to at the very minimum, redefine it in terms that Adam Smith would be tasked to recognise as decendent from his core ideas.
Both streams of human ideology were attempting to solve evident problems that had become more evident/prominent with the birth and growth of the concept of the nation state. Both can be seen with hindesight as having failed in largely different ways and today we are grappling through the dark with historically capitaliist countries becoming more socialist with established welfare states while those previously on the diametrically opposite communist side are not only becoming more
capitalistic but very rih ones at that in capitalistic terms.
Again, Nature seems to be way ahead having met and organically solved these problems using solutions that for ethical reasons can not be reused directly by our societies and their leadership. Ethics coded by our lawyers has tended to traps us in a bind that does not allow morals to vary organically in line with the reality of nature. However, underlying all of this... the core pillar 'I Owe You' continues to hold society up even. However, the growing destructive
interaction we are having with this pillar continues to cause unnecessary pain and suffering.


- international reserve banking system and 'i owe you'
- Economic slumps .. why keynsianism both works and does not work. the more it is used the more it will fail and if sed against non-monetary problems it will be a disarster.

- How other western countries play the same dollar game at a lower scale yet maintaining the same wealth discrepancy
- Why the euro will falter n the sjort term but succed in the long term as political influence of groups across europe wanes in favour of having a communally stable vat of i owe you's and the collective advantage that brings

- the developing world and failed democracy/violence as vent for frustration around their position
- Inflation as "prominenttly visible skew" in 'I owe you' that goes runaway if individuals can act against it
- China is cornered into being the richest of the poor(both externally by not being part of the rich club and internally by its puritan demographics and lack of multicaultural/multinational atmospher), distributing its wealth amidst fellow poor

- the future, where will we be in 50, 100, 1000, 10000 years
- surviving the coming traumatic changes. maintain and teach your children to maintain tight control and care over thir collection of I Owe You's as well as watching out for collective dillution of this pool and hedging its inflationary skewing


- bentham et al had Darwin in mind but they too were solving the problem of governing states
they have also failed

Certain thinkers and leaders throughout history have elaborated on and executed this mantra towards disarstrous consequeneces. They all dreamed of making the world one big family but ended up killing and yet not achieving the goal.
what they all chose to ignore is that nature had already met and solved the very problems they were creating and solving anew. see, in antiquity, as the nuber of family units in contact with each other grew the family system rached its limits.
